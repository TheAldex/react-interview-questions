# REACT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
Compilation of questions (and answers) about React that can be asked in any interview related to a Frontend (or Fullstack) Developer position. You can find questions of all kinds:

- Basics questions for Juniors Developers (e.g. *What is React?*)
- Intermediate questions for more experienced Developers (e.g. *What are advantages of using React Hooks?*)
- Advanced questions for Senior Developers (e.g. *Describe Flux and MVC*)

Some questions present code snippets to illustrate the answer or because it is strictly necessary.

And just in case... Good luck!
